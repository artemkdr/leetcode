# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems. It is automatically updated using the **LeetSync - Leetcode to Github Synchronizer** Chrome extension.

## How it Works

Whenever I solve a problem on LeetCode, LeetSync automatically creates a folder for that problem in this repository. 

Every folder named according the problem number and its name from LeetCode.

Each folder contains:

* **README.md:** The problem description from LeetCode.
* **Solution file(s):** My solution code in the chosen programming language.
* **Description:** Time and memory used.

## Usage
